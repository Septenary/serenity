<h2>THATSMYBIS LOOT:</h2>

https://thatsmybis.com/

<p>construct a wishlist of their 7 most desired/impactful pieces of loot from each raid tier.
Your Wishlist is ordered by rank; a raider's #1 item is the item they wish to be eligible for soonest 
The whole raid's wishlists are then turned into <Serenity>'s priority-list for loot distribution.
</p>
<p>
The priority-list is constructed by taking the simple order of ranks in raider's wishlists. 
Ties will occur if a raider ranks an item the same rank as (an)other raider(s) in their respective wishlists.
Ties are broken by /rolls pre-raid and taken in simple order to determine the priority-list.
</p>
<p>
Before the priority-list is finished, raiders will not be able to view each other's wishlists.
Non-unique items may appear in a raider's wishlist as many times as is reasonable.
Once an item are obtained, the raider who recieved it will be removed from the priority-list placement where they recieved it.
Items which have an empty priority list - through not being wishlisted, or being recieved by all raiders who did wishlist it - will be eligible for MS>OS roll or SR
</p>
<p>
Example: [Choker of the Fire Lord] drops:
Raider A: #2 on wishlist, rolled 27 for priority
Raider B: #2 on wishlist, rolled 22 for priority
Raider C: #2 on wishlist, rolled 44 for priority, recieved it last week
Raider D: #5 on wishlist
#Priority: C > A > B > D (>SR>MS>OS)
</p>
<p>
Raiders A, B, C had a three way tie settled before raid.
Raider C recieved it already and because the item is unique, could not have wishlisted it twice to win it again.
Raider D did not have to roll for priority because no one else put that item as #5 on their wishlist
Raider A is next in the priority-list, and recieves the item master-looted into the bag blazingly quickly.
</p>
<p>
NEW RAIDERS
New raiders will have a 2 week trial period where they can only win items with empty priority lists (through SR>MS>OS). We're looking for raiders and people who want to be part of our raid team; not pick-ups and people who only want to recieve loot from our team. During this period they cannot see other raider's wishlists, and will construct their own. After three consecutive weeks of not missing a raid, trial raiders will be a 100% member of the raid team and will be added to the priority-list as a normal raider.
</p>
<p>
Attendence
If you need to miss a raid there's a channel here to let us know you won't be around. ‚Å†missing-raid channel, just a quick note there is all it takes to be excused and not accidentally be assigned to sheep, banish, tank, or hibernate a mob in our raid while you're away or busy.
</p>
<p>
If you sign-up as attending a raid, we'd like you to not be late, unprepared, or no-call-no-show. It's a small commitment, but one that may affect 39 other players.
After 2 weeks of missing raids without notice, meroe loses trust in the certainty of you being there, ready to raid, on time, and able to fulfill your assignments.
</p>
<p>
As a penalty/encouragement, your rank in the priority-list will be deducted -1 across the board. Additional abesences will likely result in a replacement in our roster. Extenuating circumstances may be discussed with officers, real-life comes before pixels.
</p>
<p>
SUMMARY:
Make wishlist -> roll for ties -> priority-list done -> ready to raid.
Serenity raiders choose the loot priority. /rolls handle the drama.
